# ESP-Report-Card

This R program created the Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profile (ESP) for the uku fishery. The idea behind an ESP report card is to provide managers, scientist, stakeholders, stock assessment teams, and the general community a one page summary of the vulnerability of a specific fishery to changes in socioeconomic and ecological conditions. The output generated in this R program will examine the relationship between fishery activity (e.g., effort and participation) and a set of socioeconomic and ecological indicators. This analysis goes one step further and also compares the vulnerability of the uku fishery to the vulnerability of other fisheries within the same region. 

*Structure* 

All data sets used are non-confidential and are provided in the *Data* folder. 

Open up the R project *ESP.Rproj*

Program scripts can be found in the *Programs* folder which are categorized as *Data Analysis* and *ESP one pager*. The former working directory will produce 270+ figures and 100+ tables. The latter will compile a 1-2 page ESP report card based on the figures and tables of the end-users choosing.
